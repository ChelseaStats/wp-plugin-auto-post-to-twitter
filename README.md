#### wp-plugin-auto-post-to-twitter

Lightweight plugin that simply tweets when a new article is published.

this is deliberarely lightweight and thus has some requirements:

1. oauth keys coded into the script
2. author needs twitterid meta data, or script needs to change to user nice_username or some such thing that coincides with the twitter handle


the plugin doesn't user the options table to store keys or users and i don't care, 
I just wanted to replace the buggy wp-to-twitter plugin
and there was a distinct lack of options out there.
